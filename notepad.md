# notes for building 

## requirements  


1. On the index page, create an array of objects and render it to the page
then add input fields for new values to be added
set up a button that will add the values to the array and update the DOM
use an event modifier (you can use a second button for this example if it makes more sense)

2. Create a component that dispatches an event
your event should render onto the page

3. Create another component that wraps around the component in step 3
use forwarding so that the inner event can be triggered from the page

4. Add a prop (ie: a title) to the outer component and apply that on the page
Create an inline event handler
use this to manipulate css
